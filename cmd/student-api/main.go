// some structure basics:
/*
config usually has two config files dev and prod for obvious usecases
we also would have to serialise config as some golang struct for it to be used inside the project by go program  s
internals or pkg in projects is for the packages that are internally used i.e, inside the project and not exposed as such
we had virt-launcher for example
